I happend to get 2 different toshiba satellite laptops  (2007 and 2012) which have exactly the same boot system and bios (no choice between bios en UEFI...). I used a 16Gb pendrive to try Ubuntu and they both work very well when working from the USB drive. I installed Ubuntu 15.10 on both laptops: one with a 250Gb old HDD and the newest one with a Sandisk 120Gb SSD. I tried installing besides Windows and also from a custom install. No luck, after 3 days of searching and trying different ways, I get the same results on both systems: boot hangs with the black screen with the message saying &quot;Gave up waiting for root device... Busybox...(initramsfs)&quot;. I tried the Boot-Repair, it did repair different files, but no luck, neither laptop can boot by itself, but the GRUB file boots ok, I have the choice of OS on the old one (I want to keep Windows Vista on that one in another partition on the same disk). But on the newest one, I only have Ubuntu installed and I still see the GRUB file. Here is the result of the repair report on the newest system: <br /><br /><a href="http://paste2.org/n80mJcK5" target="_blank">http://paste2.org/n80mJcK5</a><br /><br />What did I overlooked ?<br /><br />Thank you<br />David - new to Ubuntu<br />Montreal</div>]]></content:encoded>			<category domain="http://ubuntuforums.org/forumdisplay.php?f=333"><![CDATA[Installation & Upgrades]]></category>			<dc:creator>david474</dc:creator>			<guid isPermaLink="true">http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2305646</guid>		</item>		<item>			<title>Help with raid 10 install</title>			<link>http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2305639&amp;goto=newpost</link>			<pubDate>Tue, 08 Dec 2015 02:34:58 GMT</pubDate>			<description>Hello all.

So thought it would be an easy task...<br />However, now I realized that I cannot waste more of my precious working time (don't want to get into trouble with my new boss...) and decided to install ubuntu on another hard drive (and swap hard disks everytime I need to boot the other OS... which would suck A LOT... but did not see another choice... just space for one HDD in the PC).<br /><br />So, I deleted all partitions (again.....) and I installed ubuntu from an USB stick, installation went well (again...), but after restarting there is just a black screen with a flashing dash in the top left corner (did that 3 times now, everytime the same result).<br />Any idea what went wrong?<br />Old computer, no EFI; not trying to boot from a wrong device or so; set boot flag with gparted (which I read somewhere else)...<br /><br />I am quite sure I am not the first person with this problem, but still I did not find anything useful in the forums, thats why I post here.<br /><br />Would be great if anybody has an idea about this...<br /><br />Thank!<br />Jay</div>]]></content:encoded>			<category domain="http://ubuntuforums.org/forumdisplay.php?f=333"><![CDATA[Installation & Upgrades]]></category>			<dc:creator>jay108</dc:creator>			<guid isPermaLink="true">http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2305578</guid>		</item>		<item>			<title><![CDATA[[ubuntu] Very very desperated:libgcc_s.so.1 must be installed for pthread_cancel to work]]></title>			<link>http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2305568&amp;goto=newpost</link>			<pubDate>Mon, 07 Dec 2015 11:42:55 GMT</pubDate>			<description><![CDATA[I m using ubuntu 15.04  and getting the errors bellow and master google is not helping: OpenOpcUa:4143504000> Loading ./ ConfigOpenOpcUa.xml OpenOpcUa:4143504000> Your XML configuration file : ./ConfigOpenOpcUa.xml has been parsed OpenOpcUa:4143504000>...]]></description>			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>I m using ubuntu 15.04<br /><br />and getting the errors bellow and master google is not helping:<br />OpenOpcUa:4143504000&gt; Loading ./ ConfigOpenOpcUa.xml<br />OpenOpcUa:4143504000&gt; Your XML configuration file : ./ConfigOpenOpcUa.xml has been parsed<br />OpenOpcUa:4143504000&gt; ApplicationUri=urn:localhost:OpenOpcUa:4CEUAServer<br />OpenOpcUa:4143504000&gt; Server listening at :<br />	opc.tcp://localhost:2564/4CEUAServer.<br />OpenOpcUa:4143504000&gt; 1306 Nodes in the addressSpace split in <br />	173 Objects 827 Variables 0 Views 34 Methods <br />	96 ObjectTypes 26 ReferenceTypes 114 DataTypes 36 VariableTypes<br />OpenOpcUa:4143504000&gt; Press Q or q to exit.<br />libgcc_s.so.1 must be installed for pthread_cancel to work<br />Aborted (core dumped)</div>]]></content:encoded>			<category domain="http://ubuntuforums.org/forumdisplay.php?f=333"><![CDATA[Installation & Upgrades]]></category>			<dc:creator>hoboy</dc:creator>			<guid isPermaLink="true">http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2305568</guid>		</item>		<item>			<title><![CDATA[[ubuntu] Getting a black screen when installing or Live booting Ubuntu (any version) in my lap]]></title>			<link>http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2305567&amp;goto=newpost</link>			<pubDate>Mon, 07 Dec 2015 11:14:37 GMT</pubDate>			<description>I have an ACER Aspire laptop.

In my third drive, I had openSUSE installed. Every time you started the computer it would have the Grubloader open up and you could choose an operating system, openSUSE or Windows.<br /><br />I wanted to give Ubuntu a shot, since it's been years since I last used it, and when I put the install disc in, it didn't detect the Windows partitions or the two hard drives in raid 0. It only detected the openSUSE partition and the swap partitions. I thought okay, no problem, and partitioned the entire third hard drive to have Ubuntu installed.<br /><br />Now this is the problem, Ubuntu installed fine, but I'm not able to boot into Windows. If I choose to boot through the Raid 0 drives, Ubuntu loads up instead. When I take out the third hard drive and restart the computer, it goes into Grub Rescue mode. I put the Windows installation CD back in, and it was able to detect the Windows partitions and it was able to detect that Windows 8 was still installed, but programs like gParted say &quot;Unallocated&quot; for one of the hard drives in raid 0, and &quot;Unknown&quot; for the other hard drive.<br /><br />How to get Windows to load correctly again? Did the openSUSE grubloader somehow 'encrypt' the hard drives in a way so that only grubloader could see it?</div>]]></content:encoded>			<category domain="http://ubuntuforums.org/forumdisplay.php?f=333"><![CDATA[Installation & Upgrades]]></category>			<dc:creator>megawatt2</dc:creator>			<guid isPermaLink="true">http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2305524</guid>		</item>		<item>			<title>Can I Clean-Install UEFI Version of 15.04 over Legacy without Losing Data?</title>			<link>http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2305506&amp;goto=newpost</link>			<pubDate>Sun, 06 Dec 2015 18:09:37 GMT</pubDate>			<description>Post deleted.</description>			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Post deleted.</div>]]></content:encoded>			<category domain="http://ubuntuforums.org/forumdisplay.php?f=333"><![CDATA[Installation & Upgrades]]></category>			<dc:creator>dswaugh</dc:creator>			<guid isPermaLink="true">http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2305506</guid>		</item>		<item>			<title>Killed my Boot Manager</title>			<link>http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2305496&amp;goto=newpost</link>			<pubDate>Sun, 06 Dec 2015 17:07:46 GMT</pubDate>			<description><![CDATA[Hi,  I have Win 10 installed on my computer.

This morning Windows 10 upgraded and corrupted Grub. When I booted after the upgrade the grub emergency boot came up. I tried boot repair with and it's report is at <a href="http://paste.ubuntu.com/13728135/" target="_blank">http://paste.ubuntu.com/13728135/</a>. It fixed it so that both Windows will now boot but Ubuntu and Grub will not. In looking at the disks with gparted it shows the partition where Ubuntu was as unallocated. Is there any way to restore the partition and grub or do I need to reinstall Ubuntu?<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Paul</div>]]></content:encoded>			<category domain="http://ubuntuforums.org/forumdisplay.php?f=333"><![CDATA[Installation & Upgrades]]></category>			<dc:creator>paul242</dc:creator>			<guid isPermaLink="true">http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2305437</guid>		</item>		<item>			<title><![CDATA[[SOLVED] Upgrade to 15.10 results in login returning after password is entered]]></title>			<link>http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2305436&amp;goto=newpost</link>			<pubDate>Sun, 06 Dec 2015 05:08:47 GMT</pubDate>			<description><![CDATA[What should have been an easy night has turned into a nightmare.

Upgrading my secretary's PC to 15.10 so she can use same version of evolution I am using (3.18.2).  Secretary's PC has nvidia graphics GT218 Geforce 4800.  First attempt at upgrade (over existing install -- worked like a champ 3X before) resulted in logon screen coming on as expected (but no nVidia banner as on my Dell laptop) with me sec's name.  I enter her password, screen goes black, and the comes back asking for the password.<br /><br />I have tried some of the usual fixes (e,g, purging video drivers and starting over, trying nouveau drivers, etc.  When I did a sudo apt-get update &amp;&amp; sudo apt-get upgrade, mayh new programs were loaded.  Should have been a winner, but same problem exists.  I can use the PC is Guest mode no problem. CLI works fine.<br /><br />So, what do I need to do to fix this problem.  I has come up many times before and various fixes exist on the internet.<br /><br />What is going on with the PC and how do I fix it?<br /><br />Thank you,<br /><br />John</div>]]></content:encoded>			<category domain="http://ubuntuforums.org/forumdisplay.php?f=333"><![CDATA[Installation & Upgrades]]></category>			<dc:creator>cigtoxdoc</dc:creator>			<guid isPermaLink="true">http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2305436</guid>		</item>	</channel></rss>
