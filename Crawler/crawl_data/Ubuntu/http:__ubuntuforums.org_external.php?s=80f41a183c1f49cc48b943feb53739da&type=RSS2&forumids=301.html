Will the MythTV system work despite the lack of TV reception? Can MythTV be used as &quot;IPTV.&quot; Should I go for it or build stand alone Linux /XBMC/Kodie server??? I wonder which  build will get results fast and easy.  I also need to consider any routing functions of Linux, as I have been using two different ISPs to save on data usage charges. I thought I ing functions available with Linux server. Hope so! I could never afford Microsoft software and since retirement have been wanting a home server. I am unsure if I need a server, but am starting a build. All of my hardware is from old PCs. I have two video capture cards and a Gateway BTX MB with no case. This system used to rock with xp. I am gonna see if it will post. At least I can clear out this stuff if it does not work. I have four PCs, one of which has 6 sata II inputs and may possibly become a free NAS if it posts. IF any one has built a system from junk and using it, I could use advice. First will be starting with Linux, it may be harder than it looks, but I am not buying anymore Microsoft stuff so we'll see. I need a word processor to replace Microsoft office 2007 also. I hope this works. I don't want to make a bootable usb drive. I don't like usb drives anyway. I am trying DVD first.</div>]]></content:encoded>			<category domain="http://ubuntuforums.org/forumdisplay.php?f=301">Mythbuntu</category>			<dc:creator>trey10</dc:creator>			<guid isPermaLink="true">http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2303571</guid>		</item>		<item>			<title>Mythtv user job returned non-zero</title>			<link>http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2303552&amp;goto=newpost</link>			<pubDate>Thu, 19 Nov 2015 19:57:28 GMT</pubDate>			<description>This maybe something easy I have over looked but I am unable to get Mythtv to execute any scripts.

I set it up as an &quot;unknown&quot; remote in the Logitech setup as they didn't have it in their database.  This allowed me to put it into 'learning' mode so that I could teach it via the old remote. <br /><br />The trouble is when I use the new remote (harmony) nothing works - when using irw nothing is displayed.  I'm not sure if it's a problem with my harware.conf file or whether there is something more fundamentally wrong - like I need to use a different IR receiver other than the one that's built into the DVICO.<br /><br />If anyone has any suggestions about how I can get it to work it would be great.<br />Thanks,<br />Luke</div>]]></content:encoded>			<category domain="http://ubuntuforums.org/forumdisplay.php?f=301">Mythbuntu</category>			<dc:creator>luke52</dc:creator>			<guid isPermaLink="true">http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2303488</guid>		</item>		<item>			<title><![CDATA[How to stop duplicate record entries that didn't record showing in watch recoreded]]></title>			<link>http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2303038&amp;goto=newpost</link>			<pubDate>Sun, 15 Nov 2015 23:59:57 GMT</pubDate>			<description><![CDATA[Hi, I'm a newbie to these forums.

I've setup a backend and a test frontend before I look to convert my 3 x Windows media centres.  The weekend was a fun journey to get my remote control working and sleeping / resuming the box.<br /><br />At present there is one thing that's adversely affecting the WAF.<br /><br />I have setup various recording rules.  Recordings are happening nicely.  I have most shows set to suppress duplicates.  This seems to be working fine too.  The problem I have is that when it finds a duplicate and doesn't record it does show in the list of recorded TV, has a zero size and an &quot;X&quot; in a circle next to it.  So in effect a new group for say &quot;X-Files&quot; turns up in the list of TV to watch, has one entry which really isn't a recording.<br /><br />I'm quite happy that the show didn't record, but it turns up in the list of recorded shows until I delete the entry.  Is there a way to turn this function off?  (I know despite looking there are plenty of features I haven't found yet!)</div>]]></content:encoded>			<category domain="http://ubuntuforums.org/forumdisplay.php?f=301">Mythbuntu</category>			<dc:creator>ddh2</dc:creator>			<guid isPermaLink="true">http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2303038</guid>		</item>		<item>			<title>Picture height wrong on playback</title>			<link>http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2302596&amp;goto=newpost</link>			<pubDate>Wed, 11 Nov 2015 20:52:26 GMT</pubDate>			<description><![CDATA[I have Mythbuntu with the latest updates.

It just works, as it should. Can someone give me any additional info I may need on what the process would be to upgrade my old centos box to mythbuntu? <br /><br />My original plan was to export the mysql database then install mythbuntu fresh and import the database. I believe the frontend or mythtv-setup knows about the schema differences and automatically upgrades the database? <br /><br />Any input would be appreciated.

I have come to the conclusion that I am simply not currently receiving the PSB3 mux from crystal palace transmitter for some reason. All other mux's are receiving fine, on this tuner (290e) and my other tuners, and according to the signal meter script I'm getting about 79% quality on all the other mux's.<br /><br />   <br /><br />  I suspect that some recent hoovering around a cabling area in my living room is the culprit but fiddling with all of that and trying to retune is going to be a nightmare!<br /><br />   <br />  So, my plan is to use this signal strength script (<a href="http://www.linuxtv.org/wiki/index.php/Testing_reception_quality" target="_blank">http://www.linuxtv.org/wiki/index.ph...eption_quality</a>) against a known good channels.conf from the crystal Palace transmitter, focussing on just the HD channels. <br /><br />Only trouble is I don’t have a channels.conf that contains the details of the mux I’m after, and am unable to create one myself as I am not getting said mux!<br /><br />   <br /><br />  Bit of a long shot all round I guess!!<br /><br />Cheers<br /><br />Rob</div>]]></content:encoded>			<category domain="http://ubuntuforums.org/forumdisplay.php?f=301">Mythbuntu</category>			<dc:creator>roburk</dc:creator>			<guid isPermaLink="true">http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2302443</guid>		</item>		<item>			<title>How to update Ubuntu?</title>			<link>http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2302368&amp;goto=newpost</link>			<pubDate>Tue, 10 Nov 2015 01:24:29 GMT</pubDate>			<description>Started with a fresh build of Mythbuntu 14.04.2 32 bit on a Dell Inspiron Mini dual boot with Win7.

Installed easily, configured without a hitch, and pretty much ran right out of the box. Was able to make 2 short successful recording, and everything but uPnP seemed to be working. Software Updater gave notification of new components, so I loaded those. Afterwards, could not record (but could playback, and Live TV). I could click on the program I wanted to record, but there was not change on the screen except for yellow text at the top right that said &quot;Not Recording&quot;.<br /><br />I then loaded the MythTV package from the .27 Repository. Same issues, not able to record or uPnP, but can playback and do LiveTV.<br /><br />There was then one more Software Updater notification about new packages, and it asked for a reboot afterward, but there was no change in function or issues. <br /><br />There is a Mythsocket issue where it then adds a local backend, then connects back to the Master backend.
